        paragraph: "A typical bottle of cleaner is 90% water and a whole lot of single use plastic. Neat was created to provide an alternative when caring for our homes. At neat, with the help of CPPC, we make beautiful cleaning products that perform brilliantly and cut down on waste. No single use plastic and no need to ship water around the world. Our vegan and cruelty free cleaning products have plant derived and biodegradable ingredients, are plastic free and made in Great Britain. Simply mix them with tap water in our reusable aluminium refill bottle for a great clean without the plastic waste.",

        paragraph: "This product shows up the idiocy and heavy carbon burden of shipping around water in consumer products by simply being a brilliant alternative. Here you get only the concentrate in a little glass bottle to which you add water and decant into a reusable cleaning bottle made from aluminium with a trigger spray. The antibac refill is nicely scented (mango and fig) and just needs to be poured in carefully and mixed with 470ml of water from your tap. There is a range of three products, which are all you need for a clean home.  The chemistry is not groundbreaking but the decluttering possibilities are as enticing as the decarbonising",

CPPC are a rare find with an incredible network and knowledge of the packaging and product development industry and can basically solve any packaging problem. Not only that but they do it with agility, great results and are a pleasure to work with",
