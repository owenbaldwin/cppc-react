        paragraph: "We can carbon footprint anything from a poster to a building and even a full end-to-end supply chain! The best place to start is the carbon footprint of what is under your direct control, before thinking about materials, distribution or what happens to your product at the end of its life – these can be done afterwards.  Whilst many of our customers are printers, print managers and design agencies, we also deal with the mega-brands to help them drive carbon reduction programmes in their print supply chain. An operational carbon footprint starts with baselining from two years of carbon emissions as this allows for peaks and troughs from trading.  We support this plan with a set of detailed recommendations to help the carbon reduction process for the next 12 months and repeat the project quarterly or annually to certify the reduction. ",

We are taking responsibility for the future of our products. Namsû products are packaged using our refill and recycle system. Unlike a refill pouch, our bottles are 100% kerbside recyclable. Whenever you use a refill, you use up to 60% less plastic than if you would have purchased a traditional bottle and pump. Refill more to save more.",
