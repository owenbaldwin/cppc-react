    text: "Fortnum & Mason is as iconic in luxury food as it's possible to be. Here at CPPC we were charged with bringing their luxury mince pie collection to life with food grade carton gift boxes using Pantone litho printing and intricate high definition foiling. Along the way among the many challenges we met the biggest one was preventing all that butter from migrating through the board while avoiding any polymer based laminates that would impact the recyclability of the boxes.",

    text: "Established twenty years ago, Tilly Sveaas founded her eponymous jewellery brand whilst on a prolonged gap year in Bali. Tilly wanted CPPC to create a revised set of gift packaging that would enhance and uphold the core values of her stunning jewellery and brand but with a keen eye on the environment. Using a pallet of deep dyed paper throughout the range and marrying that with the textile elements of the gift sets the result is minimal and neutral to enhance the unboxing experience.",
