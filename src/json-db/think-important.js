    text: "No longer just a buzz word this really has to mean something and here at CPPC we try to inject this into the conversation right from the get go. The solutions are coming thick and fast these days and don’t have to cost the “earth” so this has to be a priority for every partner at CPPC.  This being such a key priority for CPPC we have now become an approved partner with the Carbon Quota so we can integrate the route to a carbon positive brand from the outset where required."
